  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires calebporzio/sushi ^2.5 -> satisfiable by calebporzio/sushi[v2.5.0, v2.5.1, v2.5.2, v2.5.3].
    - calebporzio/sushi[v2.5.0, ..., v2.5.3] require ext-sqlite3 * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's sqlite3 extension.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - C:\xampp\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-sqlite3` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
